  <!-- 
   | Logback classic >> Logback core >> SLF4J API so we expect the following
   | shape:
   |
   | lib/
   |   logback-classic
   |   ext/
   |     logback-core
   |     slf4j-api
   |
   | In this case we expect logback core to act as an exclude in the parent
   | artifact set so that it will only be resolve in the child artifact set.
